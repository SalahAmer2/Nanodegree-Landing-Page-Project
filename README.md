# Landing Page Project

## Description

This is a Landing Page that:
* highlights sections in the viewport
* has a navbar that has active (_when section in viewport_) and hover effects for its links and hides when not scrolling (doesn't hide on page load)
* has a scroll to top button when you scroll below the fold
* has collapsible sections
* has nav links that scroll to appropriate sections
* has a number of nav links according to how many sections there are (it's **_dynamic_**)

### Note
 Linking the JavaScript file with the script tag in the head instead of at the bottom of the body will cause many of the functionalities to not work.
